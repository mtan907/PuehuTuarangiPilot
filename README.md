Hello all, thank you for reading my report!

Please find within this repository all base R code for figure generation, the original R markdown file used to generate the initial report document, and CSV databases used for analysis.

When downloading the R code, make sure to set your repository (the "setwd" line) to the location in which all of your datasheets are saved.

Kia kaha, ngƒÅ mihi nui,

Mitchell Tan
